### **Overview**
The purpose of this project is to investigate the distribution of averages of 40 samples selected 1000 times from the exponential distribution and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. Using R, the exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Let lambda = 0.2 for all simulations. 

Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials as follows:

1. [Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.](#q1)
2. [Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.](#q2)
3. [Show that the distribution is approximately normal.](#q3)


### **Simulations**
##### Randomly Select 40 values from an Exponential Distribution 1000 Times

``` {r , tidy = TRUE}
#### Libraries
    library(ggplot2)

#### constants
    lambda <- 0.2
    n <- 40
    hist_breaks = 65
    set.seed(69)

#### Calculate Means
mns = NULL
for (i in 1:1000){mns = c(mns , mean(rexp(n , lambda)))}

```


##### **Examine the means generated**


``` {r , tidy = TRUE}
str(mns)
sd(mns)
summary(mns)

```



##### **Create Visual Display of Results** 

``` {r}

val <- hist( mns,  
             breaks = hist_breaks, 
             prob = TRUE, 
             xlab ='Means of exponential distribution with',
             main = 'Histogram of 1,000 means of a 40 observation exponential distribution ')

abline (v = mean(mns), 
            col="red", 
            lwd = 3,  
            text(7, 0.53, paste("Observed Mean = " , round( mean(mns), digits = 3)), col = "red"))

abline (v = 1/lambda, 
            col="blue", 
            lwd = 3 , 
            text(7, 0.5, paste("Theoretical Mean = " , format( 1/lambda , digits = 3)) , col = "blue"))

```


### <a name="q1"></a>**Question 1: Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean**
##### - The mean of the 1000 trials of 40 samples from the exponential distrubution is: `r mean(mns)`
##### - The theroetical mean is 1/lambda = `r 1/lambda`


### **<a name="q2"></a>Question 2: Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance**
##### - Observed variance of the distribtion = `r var(mns)`
##### - The theoretical variance of an exponential distribution is SD ^ 2 = `r  ( (1 / lambda )  / sqrt(n) ) ^ 2`


### **<a name="q3"></a>Question 3: Distribution of Means**
##### - By inspection, the plot below shows the means are approximately distributed normally 
``` {r}

norm_dist_densities <- dnorm( val$mids , mean  = (1 / lambda ) , sd = (1 / lambda )  / sqrt(n)  )

hist(mns,  
     breaks = hist_breaks,
     prob = TRUE,
     xlab ='Means of exponential distribution with',
     main = 'Density of Means v. Normal Distrobution',
     col = 'orange')

lines(val$mids, 
      norm_dist_densities,
      col = 'grey',
      lwd = 3 )

```

##### - Comparing the experimental and normal distribution using a Q-Q plot, we see close correlation:

```{r}

qqnorm(mns , col = 'red')
qqline(mns , col = 'blue')

```
