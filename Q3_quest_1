## Note, for 95% student T confidence interval, need to select at .975 because we are finding the location on the right tail
## where there is 0.025 to the right.  Adding the error to the average gives the right boundry and subtracting gives left boundry

a <- 1100
s <- 30
n <- 9
error <- qt(0.975,df=n-1)*s/sqrt(n)
left <- a-error
right <- a+error
left
right
