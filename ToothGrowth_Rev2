### Objective
This project will analyze and conduct hypothesis testing on data describing the Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs.  The data is described at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/ToothGrowth.htmland and conduct hypothesis testing on the tooth growth R data package. 

### Executive Summary - Tooth Growth Related to Vitamin C and OJ
Data exploration of Guinea Pig tooth growth under different supplements (Vitamin C and OJ) revealed a potential relationship of tooth length v. supplement concentration.  Specifically, a higher concentration of vitamin C or OJ produced longer tooth length. In order to investigate this finding, hypothesis testing was conducted for high (2.0 mg) and low (0.5 mg) concentrations of two supplements (vitamin C and OJ). The hypothesis testing revealed that at the 95% confidence interval, tooth growth at high levels of vitamin C and OJ was indeed greater than at the lower levels of the supplement.  Specifically, the null hypothesis that there was no difference in tooth growth between high and low concentration of vitamin C and OJ was rejected and the alternative hypothesis that tooth growth was indeed effected by higher levels of the supplements was accepted.    


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Preliminary config
attach(ToothGrowth)
library(ggplot2)
toothGrowth <- as.data.frame(ToothGrowth)
```
### Data Exploration 
#### Data structure:
We first examine the data structure to find 60 records in a wide format describing tooth length (len), supplement (supp) and dose.  The supplements are represented as a factor and take on values of either Vitamin C (VC) or Orange Juice (OJ).  Doses are administered at 3 unique levels (0.5 , 1.0 and 2.0 mg).

```{r}
# Unique dose values
unique(ToothGrowth[,3])

# Unique supplement values
unique(ToothGrowth[,2])

# Data structure:
str(ToothGrowth)

# Summary of content:
summary(ToothGrowth)

# Head and tail of data:
head(ToothGrowth)
tail(ToothGrowth)
  
```


#### Exploration of Data Relationship using Plots 
Plotting the data, using the pair function, a relationship emerges between there appears between dose and tooth length.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Plot pairs of each data
pairs(ToothGrowth)

```

We further examine the relationship by plotting tooth growth by dose. This plot suggests a relationship between dose and tooth length.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}

qplot(dose , len  , data = toothGrowth , facets = ~supp) 

```

Conducting a bulk analysis by plotting mean tooth growth v. dose, again lumping the supplement together, we can observe an increase in mean tooth length with an increase in dose.

```{r echo=FALSE}
meanLength <- aggregate(ToothGrowth$len , list(ToothGrowth$dose) , mean)
colnames(meanLength) <- c('dose' , 'mean_length')

qplot(dose , mean_length , data = meanLength , xlab = 'Dose' , ylab = 'Mean Length' , main = 'Dose v. Mean Length' ) +
  geom_line(colour="red", linetype="dashed", size=1.5) +
  geom_point(size=3.0)

```

##Hypothesis Testing
Based on observations in the data exploration section, we will assert that an increase in dose of supplements OJ or vitamin C will result in an increase in tooth length.  Since we do not specify the form of the suppplement, we need to examine the effect of each supplement separately.  In the study that follows we assess outcomes for the high (2.0 mg) and the low (0.5 mg) doses of each supplement.  

###Hypothesis testing for Vitamin C
Regarding Vitamin C as the supplement and independent variable, we form the hypothesis as:

<br>   Hypothesis: Tooth Growth is not effected by Vitamin C
<br>   Ho: Tooth Growth is unaffected by increases in Vitamin C dose
<br>   Ha: Tooth Growth is effected by increases in Vitamin C dose 

<br>   Thus H0 : μ1 = μ2
<br>   Recasting: H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0 
<br>   μ1  =  case where dose is 0.5mg of Vitamin C
<br>   μ2  =  case where dose is 2.0mg of Vitamin C 

To direct our actions as to accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis (tooth growth is not effected by vitamin C, we conduct Hypothesis and Testing for Vitamin C using a t-test at a confidence interval (CI) of 95%.  If the t-statistic for the data is outside the threshold, we will reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that vitamin C increases tooth growth.  Otherwise, we will retain the null hypothesis that tooth growth is insensitive to vitamin c. 


```{r}
#### Subset data to isolate high and low doses of vitamin C
data_vc_0.5 <- subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'VC' & dose == 0.5)[,1]
data_vc_2.0 <- subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'VC' & dose == 2.0)[,1]

##### Run t-test
t.test(data_vc_2.0 , data_vc_0.5 , paired = FALSE , var.equal = FALSE , conf.level = 0.95)
````

###Interpretation and Conclusion for Results for two doses of Vitamin C:
The t-test results above show the resulting t-statistic lies well outside the 95% confidence interval. We therefore reject the null hypotheses that there was no difference in tooth growth with dose in Vitamin C.  The probability this conclusion is in error is shown in the p-value of an infinitesimally small 4.682 e-8.

##Hypothesis testing for Orange Juice (OJ)
This analysis will proceed in a similar fashion to the analysis for vitamin C. In this analysis OJ is the supplement and independent variable. We form the hypothesis as:

<br>   Hypothesis: Tooth Growth is not effected by OJ
<br>   Ho: Tooth Growth is unaffected by increases in OJ dose
<br>   Ha: Tooth Growth is effected by increases in OJ dose 

   Thus H0 : μ1 = μ2
<br>   Recasting: H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0 
<br>   μ1  =  case where dose is 0.5mg of OJ
<br>   μ2  =  case where dose is 2.0mg of OJ

We will accept or reject the null hypothesis (tooth growth is not effected by OJ, based on the t-statistic with a confidence interval (CI)  of 95%. 


```{r}

##### Subset for OJ as supplement and separate by dose focusing on the high and low dose 
data_oj_0.5 <- subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'OJ' & dose == 0.5)[,1]
data_oj_2.0 <- subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'OJ' & dose == 2.0)[,1]

##### Run t-test:
t.test(data_oj_2.0 , data_oj_0.5 , paired = FALSE , var.equal = FALSE , conf.level = 0.95)
````
###Interpretation and Conclusion for Results for two doses of OJ:
The t-test results above show the resulting t-statistic lies well outside the 95% confidence interval. We therefore reject the null hypotheses that there was no difference in tooth growth with dose in OJ.  The probability this conclusion is in error is shown in the very small p-value.


## Overall Conclusion - Tooth Growth increases with dose of Vitamin C and OJ.
For both OJ and Vitamin C, we rejected the null hypothesis (tooth growth is not effected by increasing levels of vitamin c and OJ) and accept the alternative hypothesis (tooth growth increases with increasing doses of vitamin C and OJ) based on the results of the t-test.  In both cases, the t-test indicated that the sample mean of the higher concentration of dose (2.0 mg) fell outside the 95% confidence interval.
