### Objective
#### This project will analyize and and conduct hypothesis testing on the tooth growth R data package.  The data specifically documentstThe Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs and is found at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/ToothGrowth.html


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Preliminarty config

attach(ToothGrowth)

doses <- unique(ToothGrowth$dose)
meanLength <- aggregate(ToothGrowth$len , list(ToothGrowth$dose) , mean)
colnames(meanLength) <- c('dose' , 'mean_length')



```

```{r}


# Data dimensions and observations:
names(ToothGrowth)
nrow(ToothGrowth)


# Head and tail of data:
head(ToothGrowth)

tail(ToothGrowth)

# Data structure:
str(ToothGrowth)


#Summary of content:
summary(ToothGrowth)


  
```



```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Plot pairs of each data
pairs(ToothGrowth)

plot(len, dose, main="Tooth Length v. Dose", xlab="Length ", ylab="Dose ", pch=19)
plot(meanLength$mean_length , meanLength$dose , main="Mean Tooth Length v. Dose", xlab="Length ", ylab="Dose ", pch=19)

```

# Hypothesis Testing
### Null Hypothesis H0: Tooth length is uneffected by Dose 
### Alternative Hypothesis H1: Tooth length is effected by Dose 

### The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the tooth growth for low doses of Vitamin C and OJ (0.5) and high doses of Vitamin C ### and OJ (2.0). We find the means for each condition as follows: 

####    mean tooth growth for 0.5 Vitamin C =  `r mean(subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'VC' & dose == 0.5 )[,1])`
####
####    mean tooth growth for 2.0 Vitamin C =  `r mean(subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'VC' & dose == 2.0 )[,1])`
####    mean tooth growth for 0.5 OJ =  `r mean(subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'OJ' & dose == 0.5 )[,1])`
####    mean tooth growth for 2.0 OJ =  `r mean(subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'OJ' & dose == 2.0 )[,1])`

#### Determining threshold for accepting or rejection H0 at a 95% confidence interval:

##### P( XÌ„  > C  ; H0 ) = 0.05

##### Provided the tooth growth data is normally distributed, the 95% precetile is 1.645 standard deviations from the mean.
##### The standard error of the mean is the standard error / sqrt(sample size) = `r sd(subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'VC' & dose == 0.5 )[,1]) / sqrt(length(subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'VC' & dose == 0.5 )[,1]))`
##### **For Vitamin C**
##### We reject H0 if the mean tooth growth for the 2.0 vitamin c is > `r 7.98 + .8685*1.645` 
##### With the mean tooth growth of 26.14, the mean for the 2.0 Vitamic C is clearly greater than the rejection criteria of 9.4086

##### **For OJ**
##### The standard error of the mean is the standard error / sqrt(sample size) = `r sd(subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'OJ' & dose == 0.5 )[,1]) / sqrt(length(subset(ToothGrowth , supp == 'OJ' & dose == 0.5 )[,1]))`

##### We reject H0 if the mean tooth growth for the 2.0 OJ is > `r 13.23 + 1.41028*1.645` 
##### With the mean tooth growth of 26.14, it is clearly greater than 15.5499
