### High Level Data Analysis (A.K.A. What is in ToothGrowth)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Preliminarty config

attach(ToothGrowth)

doses <- unique(ToothGrowth$dose)
meanLength <- aggregate(ToothGrowth$len , list(ToothGrowth$dose) , mean)
colnames(meanLength) <- c('dose' , 'mean_length')



```

```{r}


# Data dimensions and observations:
names(ToothGrowth)
nrow(ToothGrowth)


# Head and tail of data:
head(ToothGrowth)

tail(ToothGrowth)

# Data structure:
str(ToothGrowth)


#Summary of content:
summary(ToothGrowth)


  
```



```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Plot pairs of each data
pairs(ToothGrowth)

plot(len, dose, main="Tooth Length v. Dose", xlab="Length ", ylab="Dose ", pch=19)
plot(meanLength$mean_length , meanLength$dose , main="Mean Tooth Length v. Dose", xlab="Length ", ylab="Dose ", pch=19)

```

# Null Hypothesis: Tooth length is proportional to Dose
